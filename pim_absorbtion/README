** Overview

This is a test of pi- absorbtion in aluminum:

An electron is impingin in a beam dump, producing pi+ and pi- which decays:

** weak force (bf =  0.999877)

 - π+ → μ+ + νμ
 - π− → μ− + νμ*

** em force (bf = 0.000123)

 - π+ → e+ + νe
 - π− → e− + νe*


If pi- is absorbed in Al, as we expect, the electrons anti-neutrino νe* are suppresed.

The test counts the various neutrinos.

** Geometry

A G4_Galactive tube encompass a beam dump made of aluminum.
In the stepping action calls to event action fill the ntuple when the step is in the scoring tube.


** Compilation

With 4 cores (modify accordingly):

 - cmake .
 - make -j4


** Physics List

The example uses the geant4 extensible physics list. The default is FTFP_BERT.
The option -p physList can be used to select alternative physics modules and constructors.

 For example:

  -p FTFP_BERT_EMX  would replace the standard e.m. physics with G4EmStandardPhysics_option3
  -p QGSP_BERT+G4OpticalPhysics would use QGSP_BERT and G4OpticalPhysics
  -p QGSP_FTFP_BERT+G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics+G4OpticalPhysics would use QGSP_FTFP_BERT, G4RadioactiveDecayPhysics and G4OpticalPhysics

 To print all geant4 available physics modules and constructors use the -pap option
 
** Run :
